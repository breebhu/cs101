Video Attendance:Computer Vision
=====

We aim to make an integrated video attendance package which involves the use of Facial Recognition software. Its main purpose is to reduce human effort and to streamline the process of attendance by minimizing error and also eliminating the chance of a proxy attendance. This program hopes to revolutionize the system of attendance by creating a self-sustained facial recognition platform.
